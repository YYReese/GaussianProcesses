# Sequential design of experiments
In this project, we consider particularly the problem of global fitting, and investigate how the sequential design strategies work with
Gaussian Processes. The GP surrogate model is fitted with designs iteratively determined by sampling criteria. 
Among various criteria serving for different objectives, we will detail in four criteria, Maximum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) criterion, 
Maximum Entropy (ME) criterion, Integrated Mean Squared Error (IMSE) criterion and Integrated Mean Dawid-Sebastiani (IMDS) criterion. 
It can be shown that ME criteria in fact is equivalent to MMSE criteria in the case of GPs. Squared Error (SE) and Dawid- Sebastiani (DS) scores will be used to assess models constructed by different criteria.
